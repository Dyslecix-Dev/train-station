## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) v10+
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dyslecix-Dev/full-stack-boilerplate.git my-new-project
   cd my-new-project
   ```

2. **Reset git history and point to your own repository**

   Remove the boilerplate's commit history and push a clean initial commit to a new GitHub repo:

   ```bash
   rm -rf .git
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-org/your-app.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Fill in your Supabase credentials. See [docs/environment.md](docs/environment.md) for details on each variable.

   > **Want to explore the UI first?** You can skip env setup and run `NODE_ENV=test pnpm dev` to start the dev server with validation disabled. Auth and database features won't work, but you can browse the pages and components.
   >
   > **Using the Vercel × Supabase integration?** All env vars are populated automatically when you create a Supabase project through Vercel. The `.env.example` file includes every variable Vercel provides — some are aliases for the same value (see [docs/environment.md](docs/environment.md) for details).

5. **Configure Supabase Auth**

   In your [Supabase dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) under **Authentication → URL Configuration**:
   - Set **Site URL** to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Add `http://localhost:3000/**` to **Redirect URLs**

   For production, add your deployed domain to both fields as well.

6. **Set up the database**

   ```bash
   pnpm db:push       # Push schema to your Supabase database
   ```

7. **Start the dev server**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Pre-Launch Checklist

Before shipping, work through [CHECKLIST.md](CHECKLIST.md) — it covers branding, environment setup, email templates, database, auth configuration, and removing demo content.

## Cleaning Up

The full-stack boilerplate ships with a few demo-only files. These are safe to delete — they have no effect on the rest of the app:

| What to remove        | File(s)                                       | Also remove from                                                                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deploy button         | `components/deploy-button.tsx`                | Its `<DeployButton />` usage and import in `app/page.tsx` and `app/protected/layout.tsx` |
| Hero section          | `components/hero.tsx`                         | Its `<Hero />` usage and import in `app/page.tsx`                                        |
| Demo protected page   | `app/protected/page.tsx`                      | Replace with your own protected content                                                  |
| Example E2E test      | `e2e/example.spec.ts`                         | Replace with your own tests                                                              |
| Example profile page  | `app/protected/profile/`                      | Replace with your own profile page                                                       |

| Example nuqs hook     | `lib/hooks/use-search-params.ts`              | Replace with your own hooks                                                              |
| Example unit tests    | `lib/utils.test.ts`, `lib/rate-limit.test.ts` | Replace with your own tests                                                              |

Every removable line is also marked with a `TODO` comment in the code — search for `TODO: remove` to find them all.

## Customizing

### Branding

1. Update app name in `app/manifest.ts` and `app/layout.tsx`
2. Replace icons in `public/icons/` and splash screens in `public/splash/`
3. Modify theme colors in `app/globals.css`

### Adding UI Components

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button card dialog
```

### Adding Database Tables

1. Create a new schema file in `lib/db/schema/`
2. Export it from `lib/db/schema/index.ts`
3. Run `pnpm db:generate && pnpm db:migrate`

### Deployment

The project is configured for [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Connect your GitHub repo and deploy. For other platforms:

```bash
pnpm build && pnpm start
```

## Health Check & Uptime Monitoring

The app exposes a `GET /api/health` endpoint that tests database connectivity and returns:

- `200 { "status": "ok" }` — app and database are healthy
- `503 { "status": "error", "message": "Database connection failed" }` — app is up but the database is unreachable

This endpoint is designed for uptime monitoring services like [Better Stack](https://betterstack.com/). To set it up:

1. Create a monitor in Better Stack pointing to `https://your-domain.com/api/health`
2. Set the expected status code to `200`
3. Choose your check interval (e.g., every 30 seconds)

Better Stack will alert you when the endpoint returns a non-200 status or becomes unreachable, catching both app crashes and database outages.

## Code Quality

- **ESLint** with Next.js, TypeScript, accessibility, and Prettier configs
- **Prettier** with import sorting and Tailwind class ordering
- **Build-time env validation** via Zod in `next.config.ts`
- **Security headers** (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy)
- **Lighthouse CI** enforces accessibility scores above 90%
